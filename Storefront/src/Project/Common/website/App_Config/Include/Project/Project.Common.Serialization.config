<!--
	Unicorn.Configs.Default.config

	This is an example of how to configure a basic Unicorn configuration using your own config patch file.
	Copy this file to use as a basis for your own configuration definitions.

	Enabled configuration definition patches should be present on all environments Unicorn is present on.

	See Unicorn.config for commentary on how configurations operate, or https://github.com/kamsar/Unicorn/blob/master/README.md
